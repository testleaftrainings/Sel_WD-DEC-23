   Methods:
   ========

      Definition: A method in Java is a set of instructions or a block of code encapsulated within a named unit. It is designed to perform a specific task and can be invoked (called) from other parts of the program. Methods promote code reusability, modularization, and a more organized code structure. They are defined using the def keyword, followed by the method's signature, which includes its name, parameters, and return type.
      
      Explanation: Declaration: Methods are declared with a return type, a name, and parameters (if any). Return Type: Specifies the type of data the method will return, or "void" if it doesn't return anything. Parameters: Input values passed to the method for processing.


   Objects:
   ========

      Definition: In Java, an object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity or concept. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to the entity they represent. They are created from class blueprints and follow the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Objects interact with each other through method calls and can store and manipulate data.
      
      Explanation
      Instantiation: Objects are created from classes using the new keyword. Attributes (Fields): Define the properties of an object. Behaviors (Methods): Define the actions an object can perform.


   Conditional Statements:
   =======================

      Conditional statements are used to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. These statements allow the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The primary conditional statements in Java include:

      1. if Statement:
      Definition: The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

      Syntax:

      if (condition) {
          // Code to be executed if the condition is true
      }


      2. if-else Statement:
      Definition: The if-else statement is used to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

      Syntax:

      if (condition) {
          // Code to be executed if the condition is true
      } else {
         // Code to be executed if the condition is false
      }


      3. if-else if-else Statement:
      Definition: The if-else if-else statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. It executes the first block of code whose condition is true.

      Syntax:

      if (condition1) {
          // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
      } else if (condition2) {
          // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
      } else {
          // Code to be executed if none of the conditions is true
      }

   
   
   Control and Jump Statements:
   ============================
      
      Definition: Control statements in Java are used to manage the flow of execution in a program. They include decision-making statements

      Looping Statements: For Loop: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

      Jump Statements: Break Statement: Terminates the innermost loop or switch statement. Continue Statement: Skips the current iteration and continues to the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
